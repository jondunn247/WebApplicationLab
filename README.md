```

```


## Day 1 Questions


### General Questions



1. What option did you select for your domain (Azure free domain,  GoDaddy domain)?

```
Azure free domain
```


2. What is your domain name?

```
skor.azurewebsites.net
```




### Networking Questions



1. What is the IP address of your webpage?

```
20.211.64.15
```


2. What is the location (city, state, country) of your IP address?

```
Sydney, New South Wales, Australia
```


3. Run a DNS lookup on your website. What does the NS record show?

```

```




### Web Development Questions



1. When creating your web app, you selected a runtime stack.  What was it? Does it work on the front end or the back end? 

 ```
I selected PHP 8.1 and it works on the back end to develop dynamic and interactive web applications.
```


2. Inside the `/var/www/html` directory, there was another directory called assets. Explain what was inside that directory.

```
The assets directory contains a directory named css. Within that directory there is a file named style.css and its backup style.css.bak. This file contains the properties on how to layout, display, and style your webpage.
```


3. Consider your response to the above question. Does this work with the front end or back end?

```
CSS works with the front-end development.
```




## Day 2 Questions


### Cloud Questions



1. What is a cloud tenant?

```
A cloud tenant refers to sharing private or public computing resources, in an inclusive environment, that is protected with confidentiality from other users.
```


2. Why would an access policy be important on a key vault?

```
An access policy is important to determine what permissions are given to users, applications, or user groups to perform different tasks Key Vault secrets, keys and certificates/. 
```


3. Within the key vault, what are the differences between keys, secrets, and certificates?

 ```
The difference is that a private key is imported or generated by a service request by the Key Vault and is stored as an Azure Key. Azure Secrets refer to the account keys or passwords for the private key file. A certificate is simply a managed X.509 certificate that offers life cycle management capabilities.
```




### Cryptography Questions



1. What are the advantages of a self-signed certificate?

```
The advantages of self-signed certificates are that they're free and easy to issue. Also appropriate for internal network websites and for testing, because they've no dependencies on others for the issuance of certificates. Lastly, they can be easily modified or customized.
```


2. What are the disadvantages of a self-signed certificate?

```
Disadvantages are that they will appear to be untrustworthy to visitors, browsers and operating systems. Self-signed certificates are very risky for financial transactions and more vulnerable to cyberattacks.
```


3. What is a wildcard certificate?

```
This certificate uses the same private key to secure multiple host names related to the primary domain name.
```


4. When binding a certificate to your website, Azure only provides TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.  Explain why SSL 3.0 isn’t provided.

```
SSL 3.0 is deprecated because it is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. Weakness in its encryption algorithm causes this.
```


5. After completing the Day 2 activities, view your SSL certificate and answer the following questions:
    1. Is your browser returning an error for your SSL certificate? Why or why not?

 ```
It is not returning an error because the SSL certificate is valid
```


    2. What is the validity of your certificate (date range)?

```
March 14, 2022 - March 9, 2023
```


    3. Do you have an intermediate certificate? If so, what is it?

```
Microsoft Azure TLS Issuing CA 01
```


    4. Do you have a root certificate? If so, what is it?

```
DigiCert Global Root G2
```


    5. Does your browser have the root certificate in its root store?

```
Yes
```


    6. List one other root CA in your browser’s root store.

```
AAA Certificate Services 
```




## Day 3 Questions


### Cloud Security Questions 



1. What are the similarities and differences between Azure Web Application Gateway and Azure Front Door?

```
The similarities between Azure Web Application Gateway and Azure Front Door are that they both are layer 7 load balancers. The difference is that AFD is a non-regional service whereas AWA is a regional service.
```


2. A feature of the Web Application Gateway and Front Door is “SSL Offloading.” What is SSL offloading? What are its benefits?

```
SSL offloading uses devices alternative to the web server, for decryption and encryption. The benefits of this process allow web servers' performance to not be affected. 
```


3. What OSI layer does a WAF work on?

```
Application Layer 7 
```


4. Select one of the WAF-managed rules (e.g., directory traversal, SQL injection, etc.), and define it.

```
SQL injections are a web hacking technique that allows an attacker to insert malicious code in SQL statements to manipulate the queries within an application.
```


5. Consider the rule that you selected. Could your website (as it is currently designed) be impacted by this vulnerability if Front Door wasn’t enabled? Why or why not?

```
Yes, it could be impacted by this vulnerability. AFD is designed to function as an extra layer of protection at my network's edge. This helps protect my local network from becoming exposed if my website was compromised by a threat such as SQL injections. 
```


6. Hypothetically, say that you create a custom WAF rule to block all traffic from Canada. Does that mean that anyone who resides in Canada would not be able to access your website? Why or why not? 

```
This is correct. Anyone with an IP address located in Canada would be blocked from accessing my website.
```


7. Include screenshots below to demonstrate that your web app has the following:
    1. Azure Front Door enabled

```

```


    2. A WAF custom rule

```
